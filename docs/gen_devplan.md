# Development Sprint Plan: QR Code-Based Instructional System

**Project**: Request #001 - QR Code-Based Instructional System  
**Date**: January 2, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Based on**: @gen_backlogfull.md, @gen_architecture.md, @user_productbrief.md

---

## Sprint Planning Overview

This development plan organizes the 89 stories from @gen_backlogfull.md into logical sprints following experienced product owner best practices:

1. **Foundation First**: Establish core infrastructure (DB, API, frontend connectivity)
2. **Value-Driven MVP**: Focus on proving main value proposition (QR workflow)
3. **Component Isolation**: Build testable components that can be developed independently
4. **Early Value Delivery**: Each sprint delivers demonstrable value
5. **Sprint Size**: All sprints under 20 points for sustainable delivery

**Main Value Proposition**: Host creates property → Adds items → Generates QR codes → Guest scans → Views instructions

Authentication and complex features are NOT the main value proposition and are deferred until after MVP proves the core workflow.

---

## Sprint 1: Foundation Infrastructure (18 points)

**Goal**: Establish basic database, API, and frontend connectivity for core entities

**Reasoning**: Before building any features, we need the foundational infrastructure to store and retrieve data. This sprint creates the skeleton that all other features will build upon. These components can be built and tested independently.
