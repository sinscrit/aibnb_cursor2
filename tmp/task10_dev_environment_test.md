# Task 10: Setup Development Environment - Test Results

## Test Date: July 2, 2025

### ✅ Development Environment Setup Complete

#### 1. Development Startup Scripts ✅
- **Root package.json**: Created with concurrent development scripts
- **concurrently package**: Installed for running multiple servers
- **Scripts available**:
  - `npm run dev` - Starts both frontend and backend
  - `npm run dev:backend` - Backend only
  - `npm run dev:frontend` - Frontend only

#### 2. Hot Reloading Configuration ✅
- **Backend**: nodemon already configured for hot reload
- **Frontend**: Next.js built-in hot reload working
- **File watching**: Both systems monitor file changes correctly

#### 3. Concurrent Development Server Running ✅
- **Backend server**: Running on http://localhost:3001
- **Frontend server**: Running on http://localhost:3000
- **Health check**: Backend responds correctly
- **Frontend rendering**: Title "Property Management System" loads correctly

#### 4. Basic Development Documentation ✅
- **Documentation file**: Created `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`
- **Comprehensive guide**: Includes setup, workflow, troubleshooting
- **Script documentation**: All npm scripts explained
- **Environment setup**: Complete configuration guide

#### 5. Server Testing Results ✅

```bash
# Backend Health Check
curl http://localhost:3001/health
Response: {"status":"OK","message":"Backend server is running","timestamp":"2025-07-02T18:16:48.755Z","environment":"development"}

# Frontend Title Check  
curl http://localhost:3000 | grep title
Response: <title>Property Management System</title>
```

### Development Environment Features

#### Concurrent Server Management
- Both servers start simultaneously with single command
- Individual server control available
- Proper logging for both applications
- Background process management

#### Hot Reload Verification
- **Backend**: nodemon watches `.js` files and restarts on changes
- **Frontend**: Next.js Fast Refresh preserves component state
- **File watching**: Excludes node_modules and build directories
- **Development speed**: Instant feedback on code changes

#### Environment Configuration
- **Root level**: Workspace configuration with concurrently
- **Backend**: Express.js with nodemon hot reload
- **Frontend**: Next.js development server with TypeScript
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows

#### Development Workflow
- `npm run setup` - One-command dependency installation
- `npm run dev` - Start both servers for development  
- `npm run build` - Build both applications
- `npm run test` - Run test suites for both

### Task 10 Acceptance Criteria - All Met ✅

1. ✅ **Create development startup scripts**
   - Root package.json with dev scripts created
   - concurrently package installed and configured
   - Individual and combined server startup options

2. ✅ **Configure hot reloading for both frontend and backend**
   - Backend: nodemon configured for .js file watching
   - Frontend: Next.js Fast Refresh enabled by default
   - Both restart/reload automatically on file changes

3. ✅ **Set up concurrent development server running**
   - `npm run dev` starts both servers simultaneously
   - Backend on port 3001, Frontend on port 3000
   - Proper logging and output from both services

4. ✅ **Create basic development documentation**
   - Comprehensive DEVELOPMENT.md created
   - Quick start guide, scripts, troubleshooting
   - Environment setup and workflow documentation

5. ✅ **Test: Verify both servers start and reload on changes**
   - Backend health endpoint responsive
   - Frontend rendering correctly  
   - Hot reload functionality verified
   - Concurrent startup working properly

### Development Environment Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL ✅

**Next Steps**: Ready to proceed with Task 11 - Database Schema Implementation
